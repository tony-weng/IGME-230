## *Money Grows On Trees*

Money grows on trees is a simple idle/clicker game, where the user gains money whenever he clicks on the tree. Over time the tree will also grow money from its branches, and it can be upgraded to grow at a faster rate. As the user progresses they will be able to get more trees and better upgrades to speed up the growing process.

# Proposal

### *High Concept*
Making money by doing absolutely nothing. Something everyone has dreamed of.

### *Genre*
An idle-clicker game where you literally have to do nothing, besides occasionally clicking upgrades.

### *Platform*
Designed for desktop but possibly for all platforms.

### *Story*
Growing up in a farmer family you are used to the sight of cattle and glorious wheat fields. One day while finishing up your daily apple picking session you notice a new tree that grew from nowhere near your apple tree farm. To your surprise, the tree has money growing off its branches! You plan on
harvesting this money and creating a farm to help out your family in their financial struggles and maybe even become one of the richest people in the world!

## Esthetics
---
### *Graphics Style*
The graphics style for this game will mostly be cartoony with a mix of realistic.

### *Sound*
Most likely 8bit. There will be nice soft background music playing constantly as the game is running with each action evoking its own sound. Purchasing upgrades will probably
have the cash register sound effect. Clicking the tree will have its own sound effect.

## Gameplay
---
### *Mechanics*
The only mechanic in the game is clicking, either clicking the tree to gain money or clicking upgrades.

### *Control*
Main controls for the game is the mouse, touch/gesture if expanded to Mobile

### *Teaching the game*
The player will be taught through some simple text that appears on the screen since the game itself isn't very complicated.

### *Player Learning*
This game is fairly intuitive and not much strategy needed for this game. There won't be an official end game but there will be a point where the player can reset in order to start
a new game that will be harder to progress through with better upgrades and overall faster progression depending on how much they ended on the last game.
