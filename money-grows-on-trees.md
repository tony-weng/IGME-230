#Money Grows On Trees

##High Concept
Making money by doing absolutely nothing. Something everyone has dreamed of.

##Genre
An idle-clicker game where you literally have to do nothing, besides ocasionally clicking upgrades.

##Platform
Designed for desktop but possibly for all platforms.

##Story
Growing up in a farmer family you are used to the sight of cattle and glorious wheat fields. One day while finishing up your daily 
apple picking session you notice a new tree that grew from no where near your apple tree farm. To your suprise the tree has money growing off its branches! You plan on
harvesting this money and creating a farm to help out your family in their financial struggles and maybe even become one of the richest peoeple in the world!

##Esthetics
###Graphics Style
The graphics style for this game will mostly be cartoony with a mix of realisitc.

###Sound
Most likely 8bit. There will be nice soft background music playing constantly as the game is running with each action evoking its own sound. Purchasing upgrades will probably
have the cash register sound effect. Clicking the tree will have its own sound effect.

##Gameplay
###Mechanics
The only mechanic in the game is clicking, either clicking the tree to gain money or clicking upgrades.

###Control
Main controls for the game is the mouse, touch/gesture if expanded to Mobile

###Teaching the game
The player will be taught through some simple text that appears on the screen,  since the game itself isn't very complicated.

###Player Learning
This game is fairly intuitive and not much strategy needed for this game. There won't be an offical end game but there will be a point where the player can reset in order to strat
a new game that will be harder to progress through with better upgrades and overall faster progression depending on how much they ended on the last game.
